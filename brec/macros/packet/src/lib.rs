/// Marks a struct as a `Block` type used within the `brec` system.
///
/// This macro enables code generation for the given struct, including:
/// - A companion `BlockReferred` struct (with signature and CRC metadata)
/// - Implementations of required `brec` traits for serialization, deserialization, and streaming
///
/// ## Supported Field Types
///
/// The struct may contain any combination of the following field types:
///
/// | Type     |
/// |----------|
/// | `u8`     |
/// | `u16`    |
/// | `u32`    |
/// | `u64`    |
/// | `u128`   |
/// | `i8`     |
/// | `i16`    |
/// | `i32`    |
/// | `i64`    |
/// | `i128`   |
/// | `f32`    |
/// | `f64`    |
/// | `bool`   |
/// | `[u8; N]`|
///
/// ## Enums
///
/// You may use custom `enum` fields in your block if you provide conversions to and from a supported base type.
/// Here's an example using `Level`:
///
/// ```no_run
/// pub enum Level {
///     Error,
///     Warn,
///     Info,
///     Debug,
/// }
///
/// impl From<&Level> for u8 {
///     fn from(value: &Level) -> Self { ... }
/// }
///
/// impl TryFrom<u8> for Level {
///     type Error = String;
///     fn try_from(value: u8) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> { ... }
/// }
///
/// #[block]
/// pub struct LogBlock {
///     pub level: Level,
///     pub message: [u8; 200],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Visibility
///
/// The macro inherits the visibility of the original struct.  
/// If the struct is `pub`, the generated `BlockReferred` and trait implementations will also be `pub`.
///
/// ## Integration with Code Generator
///
/// The `#[block]` macro marks this struct for inclusion in the `brec::include_generated!()` macro.  
/// For this to work correctly, the block must be **visible** at the macro invocation site. Example:
///
/// ```no_run
/// pub use blocks::*;
/// brec::include_generated!();
/// ```
///
/// If you cannot import the block directly, you may specify the full module path via the `path` directive:
///
/// ```no_run
/// #[block(path = mycrate::some_module)]
/// pub struct ExternalBlock { ... }
/// ```
///
/// Shortcut syntax is also supported:
/// ```no_run
/// #[block(mycrate::some_module)]
/// pub struct ExternalBlock { ... }
/// ```
///
/// Using `path` works but is not recommended, as it makes the code harder to maintain.
///
/// ## Optional Attributes
///
/// The macro accepts the following optional directives:
///
/// - `path = mod::mod`  
///   Specifies the module path for this block type (used if it's not directly imported).
///
/// - `no_crc`  
///   Disables CRC calculation and verification. The CRC field is still included in the block's binary layout,  
///   but is filled with zeroes and not checked during read/write operations.
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn block(attr: TokenStream, input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    let attrs = parse_macro_input!(attr as BlockAttrs);
    let input = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);
    parser::block::parse(attrs, input).into()
}

/// Marks a user-defined type as a `Payload` for use in `brec`-compatible binary streams.
///
/// This macro enables participation of a struct or enum in the `Payload` system and code generation.
/// It automatically implements most required traits for payload integration, **except** the following:
///
/// ## Required Manual Trait Implementations
///
/// You must implement the following traits for your payload type:
///
/// - `PayloadSize`
/// - `PayloadSignature`
/// - `StaticPayloadSignature`
/// - `PayloadEncode`
/// - `PayloadEncodeReferred`
/// - `PayloadDecode<T>`
///
/// These are required to support serialization, CRC validation, and integration into packet streams.
///
/// ## Built-in Supported Payloads
///
/// `brec` automatically includes support for the following payload types without additional setup:
///
/// - [`String`](std::string::String)
/// - [`Vec<u8>`](std::vec::Vec)
///
/// When you invoke `brec::include_generated!()`, they are added to the generated `Payload` enum:
///
/// ```no_run
/// pub enum Payload {
///     // Your custom payloads
///     MyCustomType(...),
///     // Built-in default payloads
///     Bytes(Vec<u8>),
///     String(String),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Using `#[payload(bincode)]`
///
/// To simplify payload integration, enable the `bincode` feature in your `Cargo.toml`.  
/// You can then use `#[payload(bincode)]` to automatically derive all required traits for
/// any `serde`-compatible type.
///
/// ```no_run
/// #[payload(bincode)]
/// #[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
/// pub struct MyPayload { ... }
///
/// #[payload(bincode)]
/// #[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
/// pub enum MyPayloadEnum { ... }
/// ```
///
/// ## Optional Parameters
///
/// The macro accepts several optional directives:
///
/// - `path = mod::mod`  
///   Use if the payload type is defined outside the module where `include_generated!()` is invoked.  
///   This avoids having to re-export the payload, but is not recommended due to maintenance concerns.
///
/// - `no_crc`  
///   Disables CRC verification for this payload.  
///   CRC field will be written as `0`s and skipped during validation.
///
/// - `no_auto_crc`  
///   Disables CRC calculation only for `#[payload(bincode)]`, requiring a **manual implementation** of `PayloadCrc`.
///
/// - `bincode` â€“ available only when the bincode feature is enabled. It allows using any structure as a payload as
///   long as it meets the requirements of the bincode crate, i.e., it implements serde serialization and deserialization.
///   Please note that bincode has a number of limitations, which you can review in its official documentation.
///
/// ## CRC Verification Caveats
///
/// CRC is calculated based on the serialized byte representation of the payload. This implies:
///
/// - Serialization must be deterministic. Types like `HashMap` do **not** guarantee key order, causing CRC mismatch.
/// - Any nondeterministic or unstable byte layout will result in failed deserialization.
///
/// **Problematic example**:
/// ```no_run
/// #[payload(bincode)]
/// #[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
/// pub struct Problematic {
///     items: std::collections::HashMap<String, String>, // Non-deterministic order
/// }
/// ```
///
/// **Solutions**:
/// - Avoid unstable types like `HashMap`
/// - Use `#[payload(no_crc)]` to skip CRC validation
/// - Use `#[payload(bincode, no_auto_crc)]` and implement [`PayloadCrc`] manually
///
/// ## Visibility and Module Paths
///
/// If the payload is defined in another module not directly visible at the generator site, specify `path = mod::mod`:
///
/// ```no_run
/// #[payload(path = mycrate::data::types)]
/// pub struct MyPayload { ... }
/// ```
///
/// This works but is not the recommended way. Prefer explicitly importing your payload at the call site of `brec::include_generated!()`.
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn payload(attr: TokenStream, input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    let attrs = parse_macro_input!(attr as PayloadAttrs);
    let input = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);
    parser::payload::parse(attrs, input).into()
}
