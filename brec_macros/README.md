`brec_macros` is a component of the `brec` crate. While it can technically be used independently, it does **not** provide the full functionality that `brec` offers on its own.

`brec` is a toolkit for quickly and easily creating custom message exchange protocols with built-in resilience to data corruption and the ability to extract messages from mixed streams (i.e., streams that contain both `brec` packets and arbitrary non-`brec` data).

For complete documentation and usage details, please visit the main `brec` repository.
